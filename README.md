# ENED1120 project 4 and 5
My python code for project 4(currently project 5 is on the way) for ENED 1120 at the University of Cincinnati

# About
The python code runs on the ev3dev OS installed on a Mindstorms EV3 brick. 

# Notice
All the code was uploaded to show my growth in programming and how my robot was programmed. Feel free to look at it for help on your ENED project.
Please don't copy entirely.
